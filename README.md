# SOAPtyping Docmentation
----
## Intruduction
SOAPtyping is a novel HLA genotyping tool capable of producing accurate predictions from Sanger sequencing data files of both HLA classes I and II (Table1) by comparison to the IMGT/HLA database. 

>**Table 1** HLA molecules and the respective exon regions that can be analyzed by SOAPTyping

| Locus | exon|
| :--- | :--- |
| HLA-A	| 1,2,3,4,5 |
| HLA-B	| 1,2,3,4,5 |
| HLA-C	| 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 |
| HLA-DRB1	| 1,2,3,4 |
| HLA-DRB3,4,5	| 2,3 |
| HLA-DQA1	| 1,2,3,4 |
| HLA-DQB1	| 2,3 |
| HLA-DPB1	| 1,2,3,4 |
